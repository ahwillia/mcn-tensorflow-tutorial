# mcn-tensorflow-tutorial

The [`main.ipynb`](./main.ipynb) notebook contains your problem to work on. The [`tensorflow-examples.ipynb`](./tensorflow-examples.ipynb) contains some examples that may help you understand how tensorflow works -- but you should start with **main.ipynb**.

## Setup (Mac OSX or Linux)

1. Download anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads (we recommend Python 3.6).
2. Open up a Terminal window (can be found in `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`).
3. Install tensorflow.
```
$ conda install tensorflow
```
4. Download this code with the `git clone` command. (You can also download this repo as a zip file.)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahwillia/mcn-tensorflow-tutorial
```
5. Move to the tutorial folder in terminal, and start Jupyter notebook.
```
$ cd mcn-tensorflow-tutorial
$ jupyter notebook
```
6. Start with the `main.ipynb` notebook. The `tensorflow-examples.ipynb` notebook contains some miscellaneous examples to familarize yourself with tensorflow that might be helpful.
